<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</h2>
<p class="text">
   The novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, written by American author Mark Twain, 
   was originally released in February 1885 in the United States and December 1884 in the United Kingdom.
   The work, which is frequently referred to as one of the Great American Novels, was among the first in significant American literature 
   to be written entirely in vernacular English and is distinguished by local color regionalism. It is narrated in the first person by 
   Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, a buddy of Tom Sawyer and the narrator of two previous Twain books (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective). 
   The Adventures of Tom Sawyer's direct sequel is this.

<p> STORY LINE:</p>
</h2>
<p class="text">
   Like other literary works, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn weaves together a number of themes that are built around a main plot to tell a story. 
   In this instance, the narrative follows the moral, ethical, and human growth of a little boy named Huck and an escaped slave named Jim 
   as they travel down the Mississippi River and encounter numerous confrontations with the surrounding culture. 
   Freedom is what Huck and Jim are after, and the civilization that now exists along the vast river is in stark contrast to this freedom. 
   The central issue of the work is the tension between freedom and a civilized society.
