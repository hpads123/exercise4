<p> STORY LINE:</p>
</h2>
<p class="text">
In the course of the book, Atticus is required to defend Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white lady. 
Many Maycomb inhabitants are racists. Even though everyone is aware that Atticus has little chance of success, he decides to take the case. 
The reader observes the trial's progression through Scout's innocent eyes as she and her brother progressively learn from their father 
some important lessons about tolerance and empathy.
