<h2>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</h2>
<p class="text">
    George Orwell, an English author, wrote the dystopian social science fiction novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (commonly known as 1984). 
    It was Orwell's ninth and last book that he finished during his lifetime, and Secker & Warburg released it on June 8, 1949. 
    The authoritarian state in the novel was modeled after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany. 
    More broadly, the book explores the role of truth and facts in societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated. 
    Its themes center on the effects of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of people and behaviors.

<p> STORY LINE:</p>
</h2>
<p class="text">
    The novel is set in Oceania, one of three totalitarian republics that are constantly at war, in the year 1984. 
    Oceania is ruled by the all-powerful Party, which has brainwashed the populace into serving Big Brother without question. 
    Newspeak is a propagandistic language that the Party has developed with the intention of suppressing free speech and advancing its ideologies. 
    The Party maintains power through the Thought Police and ongoing surveillance. Its terms include doublethink (believing in opposing notions at the same time), 
    which is represented in the Party's slogans: "War is peace," "Freedom is slavery," and "Ignorance is strength."
