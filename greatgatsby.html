<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</h2>
<p class="text">
    The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, 
    the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.
    The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. 
    Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, 
    who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, 
    but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives.

    Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a native of the Midwest, travels to New York in 1922 in search of the American dream. 
    Across the bay from his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her philandering husband Tom, Nick, a would-be writer, 
    moves in next door to millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) (Joel Edgerton). As a result, 
    Nick is dragged into the alluring world of the wealthy and, as he observes their deceptions and illusions, writes a story of tragic love that is impossible.
